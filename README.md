# PlantWateringProject

The goal was to create a Java program that can control a Grove Beginner Kit for Arduino running Firmata4J 
and that when running this Arduino device, it can sense soil moisture in a chosen plant. The Arduino device 
was also able to receive commands from the Java program for which a water pump can pump water to 
the plant if the soil is too dry. Once the soil is sufficiently wet, the pump was to stop providing water. 
Creating an automated plant watering system is important because it exposes us (the students) to various 
object-oriented programming concepts and allows us to gain experience developing projects and learn 
skills that can have real-world applications in a broad range of disciplines.
